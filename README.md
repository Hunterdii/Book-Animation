Welcome to the Animated Book repository! This repository contains a visually appealing animated book where each page showcases different images.

## How it Works

The animated book is created using a combination of Markdown and HTML. Each page of the book is represented by a section with a unique set of images.
https://github.com/Hunterdii/Book-Animation
cd animated-book

Replace the placeholder text and image URLs with your own content. You'll also need to create an animated GIF or video that represents your animated book and replace the `https://github.com/Hunterdii/Book-Animation/assets/124852522/bc9e3acf-d939-4534-900b-05c0aff3736f` with the URL of that media.

Remember to replace "Hunter" and "animated-book" with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

Once you've made the changes, commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. The README will be automatically displayed on your repository's main page.
